#### A deep learning model to optimize California school districts' administrative resource allocation in order to maximize academic achievement. 
---

<b>Objective:</b> Raise state-wide school achievement levels (as defined by the percent of students meeting test score benchmarks) to minimize discrepencies between districts. We gathered data on district acheivement levels and staffing distributions (teacher/staff support/administrators/counselors/librarians/student support) and ran them through a neural network to predict staffing's impact on performance. We then ran an optimization algorithm on the model to find the ideal staffing levels for each district (based on their available budgets and current achievement levels) that maximizes district academic performance.
